## Stack

- STT: Whisper Turbo ASR
- TTS: Qwen3-TTS and Chatterbox-turbo
- LLMs: any LLM from [`mlx-community`](http://huggingface.co/mlx-community) (Qwen3, Llama, Mistral3, etc.)
- App: Tauri, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Rust
- Platform focus: Apple Silicon (M1/2/3/4/5)
- Hardware device: ESP32-S3

## ⚡️ Flash to ESP32

1. Connect your ESP32-S3 to your Apple Silicon Mac.
2. In OpenToys, go to `Settings` and click `Flash Firmware`.
3. OpenToys flashes bundled firmware images (`bootloader`, `partitions`, `firmware`) directly.
4. After flashing, the toy opens a WiFi captive portal (`ELATO`) for network setup.
5. Put your Mac and toy on the same WiFi network; the toy reconnects when powered on while OpenToys is running.

## 🛡️ Safety Considerations

AI systems (local or cloud) are not perfect. This project is built with data privacy and safety in mind, but there are still important limitations:

- **Hallucinations**: LLM and TTS models can give incorrect or misleading answers. This should not be treated as a source of truth.
- **Inappropriate outputs**: Adversarial or ambiguous prompts can sometimes produce unsafe responses.
- **Emotional impact**: AI should not replace real human interaction, especially for children.

*When using with children, use with parental awareness and treat this as a tool for exploration, not authority.*
